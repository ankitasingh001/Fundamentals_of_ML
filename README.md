# Fundamentals_of_ML
FML course assignments and projects.

## Assignment 1:
Based on linear regression (From scratch )
The assignment is divided into two parts. The first part is implementing LinearRegression class and various loss functions (along with their gradient
functions). The base code is given and you are required to fill the unimplemented functions.
The second part of the assignment is to use the above part to perform well on the Kaggle
leaderboard.

## Assignment 2:
Based on feed forward network (from scratch)
The first part ​ Part A​ is
implementing all class functions and loss, activation functions (along with their gradient
functions). The base code is given to you and you are required to fill the unimplemented
functions or part of the function. In the second part ​ Part B ​ of the assignment, you have to
achieve the desired accuracy over datasets (XOR and MNIST datasets)

##Project
Based on stack overflow tag prediction
